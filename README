  Processing.js is an open programming language for people who want to program
  images, animation, and interactions for the web without using Flash or Java
  applets. Processing.js uses Javascript to draw shapes and manipulate images
  on the HTML5 Canvas element. The code is light-weight, simple to learn and
  makes an ideal tool for visualizing data, creating user-interfaces and
  developing web-based games.

  The Processing language was created by Ben Fry and Casey Reas. It evolved
  from ideas explored in the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the MIT Media
  Lab and was originally intended to be used in a Java run-time environment. In
  the Summer of 2008, John Resig ( inventor of jQuery ), ported the 2D context
  of Processing to Javascript for use in web pages. Much like the native
  language, Processing.js is a community driven project, and continues to grow
  as browser technology advances.

  PLATFORM AND BROWSER COMPATIBILITY
  
  Processing.js is explicitly developed for and actively tested on browsers that
  support the HTML5 <Canvas> element. Processing.js runs in FireFox, Safari, 
  Chrome and Opera but is not currently supported in Internet Explorer.
   
  Processing.js aims for 100 percent compatibility across all supported browsers; 
  however, differences between individual canvas implementations may give 
  slightly different results in your sketches.  
  
  Implementing Processing.js in Flash or Silverlight is not recommended, as Java
  already occupies the browser plug-in space for this library. For users
  wishing to run Processing.js in Silverlight, see Paul Irish's Silverlight
  implementation. Using Internet Explorer Canvas with Processing.js typically
  results in unusable frame-rates for moderately complex visualizations.
                            
  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

  SETTING UP A SIMPLE SKETCH
  
  In order to get a sketch going in the browser you will need to download the 
  processing.js file and make two new files - one with the extension .html and 
  the other with the extension .pde or .pjs.
   
  The .html file will have a link to the processing.js file you have downloaded,
  and a <canvas> tag with a link to the .pde or .pjs file that you made.
  
  Here is an example of an .html file:
  <html>
    <head>
      <script src="processing.js"></script> //ensure a correct path to the file
    </head>
    <body>
      <canvas data-processing-sources="anything.pjs"></canvas> 
    </body>
  </html>
  Note that the .pjs file needs to be named anything.pjs (or whatever you named your file)
  and that there is a custom attribute data-processing-sources that is used to link the sketch to
  the <canvas>.
  
  Here is an example of a .pjs or .pde file:
  
  void setup()
  {
    size(200,200);
    background(125);
    fill(255);
    noLoop();
    PFont fontA = loadFont("courier");
    textFont(fontA, 14);  
  }

  void draw(){  
    text("Hello Web!",20,20);
    println("Hello ErrorLog!");
  }

  THINGS TO KNOW AS A PROCESSING DEVELOPER USING PROCESSING.JS
  
  Processing.js has no data directory

  Processing uses the concept of a data directory, where images and other
  are located. Processing.js does not include this. As a result, you should 
  always provide files (e.g., images) that are relative to your web page, 
  which is the norm on the web.  
  
  Processing.js implements Processing, but not all of Java

  Processing.js is compatible with Processing, but is not, and will never be, 
  fully compatible with Java. If your sketch uses functions or classes not 
  defined as part of Processing, they are unlikely to work with Processing.js. 
  Similarly, libraries that are written for Processing, which are written in Java 
  instead of Processing, will most likely not work.
  
  Processing.js only has two rendering modes

  Processing has many rendering modes to choose from, depending on the desired 
  quality and speed for graphics (e.g., OPENGL, P3D, JAVA2D, etc.). Processing.js 
  uses <canvas> which provides either a 2D drawing context or a 3D context based on 
  WebGL a version of OpenGL for the web. Therefore, whatever you choose, you will 
  end-up with either the 2D or 3D context.
  
  Division which is expected to produce an integer might need explicit casting

  There are a class of bugs that arise when converting Processing code to 
  Processing.js that involve integer vs. floating point division. What was 
  straight-up integer division in Processing code, when converted to Processing.js, 
  can sometimes become problematic, as numbers become doubles, and introduce a 
  fractional part. The fix is to explicitly cast any division to an integer that 
  exhibits this behaviour:
  
  // before
  int g = mouseX / i;

  // after
  int g = (int)(mouseX / i);
  
  Processing.js has to cheat to simulate Processing's synchronous I/O

  Processing uses a synchronous I/O model, which means that functions like 
  loadImage() take time to execute, and while they are running, nothing else 
  happens: the program waits until loadImage() is done before moving on to the 
  next statement. This means that you can count on the value returned by a 
  function like loadImage() being usable in the next line of code.

  Web browsers don't work like this. The web uses an asynchronous I/O model, which 
  means that functions which load external resources can't make the program wait 
  until they finish. In order to replicate Processing's load* functions, you have 
  to use a special Processing.js Directive.

  The Processing.js Directives are hints to the browser that are written in 
  comments rather than in the Processing code itself. Here is an example of 
  loadImage():
  
  /* @pjs preload="picture.jpg"; */
  PImage img;

  void setup() {
    img = loadImage("picture.jpg");
    image(img, 0, 0);
  }
  Note the syntax (below) to preload multiple images:
  
  /* @pjs preload="picture.jpg,picture2.jpg,picture3.png"; */  
  
  Processing.js requires more care with variable naming than Processing
  
  One of the powerful features of JavaScript is its dynamic, typeless nature. Where 
  typed languages like Java, and therefore Processing, can reuse names without fear 
  of ambiguity (e.g., method overloading), Processing.js cannot. Without getting into 
  the inner-workings of JavaScript, the best advice for Processing developers is to 
  not use function/class/etc. names from Processing as variable names. For example, 
  a variable named line might seem reasonable, but it will cause issues with the 
  similarly named line() function built-into Processing and Processing.js.
