  WHAT IS PROCESSING.JS?

  Processing.js is the sister project of the popular visual programming language
  Processing, designed for the web. Processing.js makes your data visualizations,
  digital art, interactive animations, educational graphs, video games, etc. work
  using web standards and without any plug-ins. You write code using the Processing
  language (or JavaScript), include it in your web page, and Processing.js does the
  rest.

  Processing.js is perhaps best thought of as a JavaScript runtime for the Processing
  language. Where Processing relies upon Java for its graphics back-end, Processing.js
  uses the web--HTML5, canvas, and WebGL--to create 2D and 3D graphics, without
  developers having to learn those APIs and technologies.

  Originally developed by Ben Fry and Casey Reas, Processing started as an open
  source programming language based on Java to help the electronic arts and visual
  design communities learn the basics of computer programming in a visual context.
  Processing.js takes this to the next level, allowing Processing code to be run by
  any HTML5 compatible browser, including current versions of Firefox, Safari,
  Chrome, Opera, and Internet Explorer. Processing.js brings the best of visual
  programming to the web, both for Processing and web developers.

  Much like the native language, Processing.js is a community driven project,
  and continues to grow as browser technology advances.  Processing.js is now
  compatible with Processing, and has an active developer and user community.

  PLATFORM AND BROWSER COMPATIBILITY

  Processing.js is explicitly developed for and actively tested on browsers that
  support the HTML5 <canvas> element. Processing.js runs in FireFox, Safari,
  Chrome, Opera, and Internet Explorer.

  Processing.js aims for 100 percent compatibility across all supported browsers;
  however, differences between individual canvas implementations may give
  slightly different results in your sketches.

  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

  SETTING UP A SIMPLE SKETCH

  In order to get a sketch going in the browser you will need to download the
  processing.js file and make two new files - one with the extension .html and
  the other with the extension .pde or .pjs.

  The .html file will have a link to the processing.js file you have downloaded,
  and a <canvas> tag with a link to the .pde or .pjs file that you made.

  Here is an example of an .html file:

  <!doctype html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <script src="processing.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <canvas data-processing-sources="anything.pjs"></canvas>
    </body>
  </html>

  Note that the .pjs file needs to be named anything.pjs (or whatever you named your file)
  and that there is a custom attribute data-processing-sources that is used to link the sketch to
  the <canvas>.

  Here is an example of a .pjs file (.pde is also acceptable):

  void setup()
  {
    size(200,200);
    background(125);
    fill(255);
    noLoop();
    PFont fontA = loadFont("courier");
    textFont(fontA, 14);
  }

  void draw(){
    text("Hello Web!",20,20);
    println("Hello ErrorLog!");
  }

  Many more examples are available on the Processing.js website.
