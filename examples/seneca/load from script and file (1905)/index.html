    <h2>Load a single sketch from multiple script fragments as well as data-processing-sources</h2>
    <p>The following sketch should load from three &lt;script&gt; elements, two
    in the header element, explicitly referring to the target canvas, one from
    the body, without an explicit target, but located before the canvas it should
    be used for. The canvas itself then also loads data from a file called
    codebase.pde</p>
    
    <p>This sketch should have mouseMove behaviour, drawing a circle at the cursor position.</p>

    <!-- third fragment, from URL, using implicit target -->

        useBlack(); // located in codebase.pde
